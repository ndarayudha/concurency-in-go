// A deadlocked program is one in which all concurrent processes are waiting on one
// another. In this state, the program will never recover without outside intervention.
//
// Deadlock Condition according to Coffman Conditions
// 1. Mutual Exclusion
//      A concurrent process holds exclusive rights to a resource at ony one time
//
// 2. Wait For Condition
//      A concurrent process must simultaneously hold a resource
//      and be waiting for an additional resource.
//
// 3. No Preemption
//      A resource held by a concurrent process can only be released
//      by that process, it fulfills this condition.
//
// 4. Circural Wait
//      A concurrent process (P1) must be waiting on a chain of other concurrent pro‚Äê
//      cesses (P2), which are in turn waiting on it (P1), so it fulfills this final condition
//      too.
